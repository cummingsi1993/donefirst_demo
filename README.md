# donefirst_demo

## Instructions for starting

- `docker-compose up --build`
- Navigate to 'localhost:5200'

## Notes

- I wouldnt do this in a production system, but for ease of showcasing i included the couchbase database in the checked in files. You should have a full functioning system including database and some existing data just from running the docker build.
